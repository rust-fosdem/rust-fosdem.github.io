### Overview

Welcome to the 1st edition of the Rust devroom,
co-located with [FOSDEM 2018](https://fosdem.org/2018/). FOSDEM is an annual
conference about free and open source software, attended by over 5000
developers and open-source enthusiasts from all over the world. 

The devroom is a colocated conference-within-a-conference that gives us the
opportunity to come together and chat, hack, and share stories about Rust usage
in FLOSS ecosystems.

The devroom will take place on Sunday, February 4th, 2018, at
[ULB (Campus Solbosch)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1632534522), in Brussels, Belgium. Join us to
enjoy a full day of talks, demos and interesting discussions on Rust.
